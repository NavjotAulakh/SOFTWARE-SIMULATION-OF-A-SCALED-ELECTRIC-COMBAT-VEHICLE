1. Problem Identification (3%): A description of the scope of the design project at hand
that has been discussed and agreed with the relevant capstone academic advisor and/or
industrial partner. This may change over the course of the project, but the discussion
provides a starting point for both the student group and the stakeholders. This is also a
unique opportunity to document these agreements and thereby eliminate any
miscommunication.

2. Project-related Background and Research Review (3%): Every group has the challenge
that they have to learn about the domain of the project. Hence a brief section giving
background information related to the specific capstone design project and research
review of the domain are required.

3. Design Process (3%): The success of any project is related to the ability of the project
team to follow a design process. A good design process will identify:

a. the overall flow of activities, actions, and tasks and the interdependencies
among them
b. the degree to which work products are identified and required
c. the manner which quality assurance activities are applied
d. the manner in which project tracking and control activities are applied
e. the degree to which the customer and other stakeholders are involved with the
project
f. the degree to which team organization and roles are prescribed

4. Scenarios and/or Use Cases (5%): Nearly all design commences with a capture of
scenarios and/or use cases that help define the functional requirements of a system.
These scenarios are helpful in also defining the acceptance tests.

5. Stakeholder Requirements and Traceability Matrix (10%): The thorough capture of the
stakeholder requirements is an important step to delivering what the “customer” wants.
There are many techniques available to capture requirements that you have learned
throughout your program. The expectations is that you apply these techniques in your
project. Good requirements are a clear “translation” of the list of customers’ needs
using precise engineering language that includes measurable and comparable variables
indicating limitation values expressed in engineering or other units (e.g., power
consumption less than 10 kW, voltage rating greater than 10 kV, less expensive than
$400.00, etc.). This list of engineering requirements needs to be traced throughout the
entire course of the development of the project until completion.

6. Definition of Acceptance Tests (3%): At this stage you should also be able to define a set
of acceptance tests that will eventually be refined and executed to demonstrate that
the product has met the requirements.

7. Project Plan (3%): You should present an overall and reasonable project plan for
achieving the deliverables outlined in this handbook.

8. Contribution matrix: All reports should include a contribution matrix detailing how each
member has contributed to the content of the report both in writing and material. The
faculty advisor can use this information to decide on individual grading.

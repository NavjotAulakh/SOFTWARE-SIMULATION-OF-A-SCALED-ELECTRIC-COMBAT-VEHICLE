| Req ID#	| Req Type	| Requirement Source	| Requirement Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| RQ1 | Client | This project requires students to design and develop an image processing algorithm..	| The development of an object detection algorithm (ODA) is integral to the project. |
| RQ2	| Client | …that can detect and classify objects and obstacles for the 8x8 Electric Combat Vehicle. | The ODA must be able to identify and categorize individual objects in a real environment. |
| RQ3	| Client | Such techniques may include, but is not limited to, convolutional neural networks and other deep learning options. | The ODA must be capable of identifying a large variety of objects, both large and small scale. |
| RQ4 | Client | …The algorithm must be compatible with ROS (Robot Operating System) | The ODA must support an interface that the ROS architecture can utilize. |
| RQ5 | Client | The algorithm should be efficient and robust and must exhibit high repeatability.” | The ODA must perform its tasks in an acceptable amount of time, and must operate in a stable state machine framework. Since ROS does not operate in real time, neither can ODA. |
| RQ6 | Client | Sourcing of compatible sensors and controller hardware for compact packaging and deployment. | The ODA must utilize sensors and controllers that is compatible with ROS. |
| RQ7 | Client | Write C++/Python code for Obstacle Detection and Classification | The ODA must be developed to be compatible with ROS, so it must be written in either Python or C++ as the programming language. |
| RQ8 | Client | Conduct testing and validation in both simulated and physical environment. | The ODA must support both simulated and physical implementation of the algorithm. The ODA must support testing and debugging in both simulated and physical environments. |
Table 1A – Requirements Specification

| Test Case ID#	| Quality Attribute | Test Case Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| TC1 | Compatibility | ODA is accessible by any ROS localization algorithm through a generic interface to generate robot localization. |
| TC2 | Functional Suitability | ODA will properly identify all distinct objects in the environment. |
| TC3 | Functional Suitability | ODA will properly categorize objects into Impassable, Passable, and Distant. |
| TC4 | Functional Suitability | ODA should be able to operate with its full feature set in Gazebo, a simulation software environment. |
| TC5 | Functional Suitability | ODA should be able to operate with its full feature set when implemented on a ROS compatible hardware device. |
| TC6 | Performance Efficiency | ODA will complete a designated course in relatively the same amount of time as a comparable laser-based implementation of an object detection algorithm. |
| TC7 | Usability | ODA should not require any extra user interaction besides installation. |
| TC8 | Reliability | ODA should operate in a stable state machine and continue running indefinitely. |
| TC9 | Reliability | ODA should be able to detect and recover from object detection related faults, and sensor disability faults. |
| TC10 | Security | ODA should not be an accessible security attack surface. |
| TC11 | Maintainability | ODA should be a modular algorithm that can be easily transplanted into new robotic devices that support ROS |
| TC12 | Portability | ODA installation should not require much more time to install then ROS alone. It should be an includable library. |

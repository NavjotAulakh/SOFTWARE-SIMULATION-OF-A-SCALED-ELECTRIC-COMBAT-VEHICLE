| Req ID#	| Req Type	| Requirement Source	| Requirement Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| RQ1 | Client | This project requires students to design and develop an image processing algorithm..	| The development of an object detection algorithm (ODA) is integral to the project. |
| RQ2	| Client | …that can detect and classify objects and obstacles for the 8x8 Electric Combat Vehicle. | The ODA must be able to identify and categorize individual objects in a real environment. |
| RQ3	| Client | Such techniques may include, but is not limited to, convolutional neural networks and other deep learning options. | The ODA must be capable of identifying a large variety of objects, both large and small scale. |
| RQ4 | Client | …The algorithm must be compatible with ROS (Robot Operating System) | The ODA must support an interface that the ROS architecture can utilize. |
| RQ5 | Client | The algorithm should be efficient and robust and must exhibit high repeatability.” | The ODA must perform its tasks in an acceptable amount of time, and must operate in a stable state machine framework. Since ROS does not operate in real time, neither can ODA. |
| RQ6 | Client | Sourcing of compatible sensors and controller hardware for compact packaging and deployment. | The ODA must utilize sensors and controllers that is compatible with ROS. |
| RQ7 | Client | Write C++/Python code for Obstacle Detection and Classification | The ODA must be developed to be compatible with ROS, so it must be written in either Python or C++ as the programming language. |
| RQ8 | Client | Conduct testing and validation in both simulated and physical environment. | The ODA must support both simulated and physical implementation of the algorithm. The ODA must support testing and debugging in both simulated and physical environments. |

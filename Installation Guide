Written by: Jeffrey Zhang

Before you begin: 
- You require at least 2GB memory to compile the files.
- You need more then 10 GB of hard drive space.

1. Install ubuntu 16.04

2. Install ros kinetic kame
Follow this guide closely: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu

3. Create catkin workspace
Example procedure that creates workspace at the root of the user's home folder.
NOTE: The rest of this guide assumes you put your catkin_ws folder in your home folder.
mkdir ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make

4. Drop our files into your catkin_ws/src folder

5. Install navigation stack
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation

6. Install teb planner
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-teb-local-planner

7. Source catkin and export gpu settings
NOTE: Replace [USERNAME] with your ubuntu username.
echo "source /home/[USERNAME]/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export SVGA_VGPU10=0" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

8. Compile our files
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make

9. Run
roslaunch bot_description gazebo.launch
roslaunch bot_description rviz.launch
